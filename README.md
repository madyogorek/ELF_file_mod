# ELF_file_mod

This project features a single required problem pertaining to the final topics discussed in lecture.

patchsym uses mmap() to parse a binary ELF file to make changes to a global symbol. Tools that work with object files like the linker associated with the GCC and the program loader must perform similar though more involved tasks involving ELF files. mmap() is very useful for handling binary files and is demonstrated in Lab 14.
